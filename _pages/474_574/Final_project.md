# Final Project Report and Final Presentation - Instructions
## MTH474/MTH574 -  Numerical Optimization


## Topic: 
For your final project report and final presentation, pick any topic of
your own choice. The topic must be related to Optimization, Numerical Optimization, Engineering
Optimization, Data Science optimization, etc. 

Possible topics (in case you are having trouble finding one):

**Option 1:** Pick **a section or a subsection** of any one chapter from the textbook Numerical Optimization
(in mycourses). Several of interesting chapters are 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. For example,
suppose you are interested in the Levenberg-Marquardt Method, then you can look at section 10.3. In your
report, you can talk about the history of the method, the algorithm, the code, and test it out on some
functions, do experiments on rate convergence, etc. You can use any codes and resources on the web (as long
as you cite them). 

**Option 2:** Pick a theorem from the textbook, where the proof is long. Explain the proof in
detail as if you are teaching it. 

**Option 3:** Pick a topic from your research or your project with your advisor.
For example, optimization algorithms used in machine learning (SGDM, ADAM, Nesterov iteration, etc),
software package in optimization, etc. 

## The Final Report: 
* The final report must be in pdf format (a maximum of 5 pages (for undergraduates) and 8 pages (for graduates)). <!--- This is worth 25% of your final grade. -->
* Your final report should be in the form more or less of an academic paper. It contains a title, author name and
affiliation, abstract, introduction, numerical results, a bit of plot/graph and visualizations, conclusion, and
references.
* You can use Grammarly or other grammar-checking software to find all typos, and errors, or help you
in your writing process.
* The codes that you use for your final project can be embedded as an appendix in the
final report. The appendix is not part of the (5-page or 8-page) limitation.
* Your final report can be written in
Jupyter Notebook, MATLAB Report Generator, MS. Word, LaTeX, Markdown, etc. However, your final report
must be submitted in a pdf format.
* Upload the pdf file to mycourses. 

## The Pre-recorded Final Presentation Video: 
* Your 15-minute pre-recorded final presentation video must be in mp4 format. You are pretty
much about the topic of your final report. This is worth 25% of your final grade.
* You should give your talk as if you are presenting at an academic conference. You must briefly describe the problem you are working on,
demonstrate your code, and provide a conclusion.
* You can record your screen and presentation talk with
Zoom. Zoom can show your presentation slides on the left and your camera on the right. This is similar to the
style of my lecture videos.
* If you show figures or other people's work, please cite the sources.
* Upload the mp4 file and presentation files (PowerPoint, Keynote, Markdown presentation, etc) to mycourses.
