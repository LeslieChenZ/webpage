  Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the association between the general managerial ability of CEOs and the readability of 10-K reports. We find that the readability of 10-K reports is lower for firms managed by CEOs with general managerial ability. Our result is robust to change analysis, alternate readability measures, various fixed effects, instrumental variables, and the propensity score approach. Our additional analysis reveals that general managerial ability is negatively associated with the readability of management discussion and analysis (MD&A). Moreover, the disclosure tone of the 10-K and MD&A is conservative when the firms are managed by generalist CEOs. Our findings also reveal that CEO tenure moderates the positive association between the general ability index and Gunning Fog index of 10-K reports. Finally, we find that overinvestment and misstatement strengthen the association between the general ability index and the readability of 10-K reports, thus supporting the obfuscation hypothesis. We thus conclude that firms incur costs in the form of lower disclosure quality when they opt for a generalist CEO. </details>

  Abstract: In this paper, we consider the high order method for solving the linear transport equations under diffusive scaling and with random inputs. To tackle the randomness in the problem, the stochastic Galerkin method of the generalized polynomial chaos approach has been employed. Besides, the high order implicit-explicit scheme under the micro-macro decomposition framework and the discontinuous Galerkin method have been employed. We provide several numerical experiments to validate the accuracy and the stochastic asymptotic-preserving property.</details>

  Abstract: In this paper, we study the linear transport model by adopting the deep learning method, in particular the deep neural network (DNN) approach. While the interest in using DNN to study partial differential equations is arising, here we adapt it to study kinetic models, in particular the linear transport model. Moreover, theoretical analysis of the convergence of neural networks and its approximated solution towards the analytic solution is shown. We demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed DNN method in numerical experiments.</details>

  Abstract: In this paper, we develop novel local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) methods for fractional diffusion equations with non-smooth solutions. We consider such problems, for which the solutions are not smooth at the boundary, and therefore the traditional LDG methods with piecewise polynomial solutions suffer accuracy degeneracy. The novel LDG methods utilize a solution information-enriched basis, simulate the problem on a paired special mesh, and achieve optimal order of accuracy. We analyze the $L^2$ stability and optimal error estimate in the $L^2$-norm. Finally, numerical examples are presented to validate the theoretical conclusions. </details>

  Abstract: In this paper, we develop a new WENO weak Galerkin finite element scheme for solving the time dependent hyperbolic equations. The upwind-type stabilizer is imposed to enforce the flux direction in the scheme. For the linear convection equations, we analyze the $L^2$-stability and error estimate for the $L^2$-norm. We also investigate a simple limiter using weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) methodology for obtaining a robust procedure to achieve high order accuracy and capture the sharp, non-oscillatory shock transitions. The approach applies to linear convection equations and Burgers equations. Finally, numerical examples are presented to validate the theoretical conclusions.</details>

  Abstract: Several different approaches are proposed for solving fully implicit discretizations of a simplified Boltzmann-Poisson system with a linear relaxation-type collision kernel. This system models the evolution of free electrons in semiconductor devices under a low-density assumption. At each implicit time step, the discretized system is formulated as a fixed-point problem, which can then be solved with a variety of methods. A key algorithmic component in all the approaches considered here is a recently developed sweeping algorithm for Vlasov-Poisson systems. A synthetic acceleration scheme has been implemented to accelerate the convergence of iterative solvers by using the solution to a drift-diffusion equation as a preconditioner. The performance of four iterative solvers and their accelerated variants has been compared on problems modeling semiconductor devices with various electron mean-free-path.</details>

Hauck, Multiscale convergence properties for spectral approximations of a model kinetic equation, Mathematics of Computation 88.319 (2019): 2257-2293. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1090/mcom/3399">DOI</a>, <a href="https://www.ki-net.umd.edu/pubs/files/paper_iso_clean.pdf">Preprint</a></summary>
  Abstract: In this work, we prove rigorous convergence properties for a semi-discrete, moment-based approximation of a model kinetic equation in one dimension. This approximation is equivalent to a standard spectral method in the velocity variable of the kinetic distribution and, as such, is accompanied by standard algebraic estimates of the form $N^{−q}$, where $N$ is the number of modes and $q > 0$ depends on the regularity of the solution. However, in the multiscale setting, the error estimate can be expressed in terms of the scaling parameter $\epsilon$, which measures the ratio of the mean-free-path to the characteristic domain length. We show that, for isotropic initial conditions, the error in the spectral approximation is $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{N+1})$. More surprisingly, the coefficients of the expansion satisfy super convergence properties. In particular, the error of the lth coefficient of the expansion scales like $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{2N})$ when $l = 0$ and $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{2N+2-l})$ for all $1 \leq l \leq N$. This result is significant, because the low-order coefficients correspond to physically relevant quantities of the underlying system. All the above estimates involve constants depending on $N$, the time $t$, and the initial condition. We investigate specifically the dependence on $N$, in order to assess whether increasing $N$ actually yields an additional factor of $\epsilon$ in the error. Numerical tests will also be presented to support the theoretical results. </details>
