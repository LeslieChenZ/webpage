# Research Highlights
My primary research objective is to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and applicability of numerical methods for solving intricate mathematical models. 

* <details> <summary>Numerical simulations for nonsmooth problems</summary>
  At the core of my research lies the goal of resolving the issue of low accuracy encountered in functions with singularities. I have developed innovative reconstruction methods that significantly enhance the accuracy of simulations of problems with singular data. Additionally, I have introduced a singularity-enriched basis for LDG methods, designed specifically to address the challenges posed by fractional diffusion equations featuring non-smooth solutions. More recently, I have been working on a sophisticated neural network-based approach aimed at automating the detection of singularities from spectral data.
