## Introduction:
Mathematical models represented by partial differential equations serve as indispensable tools across mathematical, scientific, and engineering domains. The pursuit of robust, efficient, highly accurate, and structure-preserving numerical algorithms remains a formidable challenge in simulating the multiscale/multiphysics features inherent in these models. 

The objective of this special session is to convene researchers and computational scientists to present and discuss recent advancements in the design, analysis, and implementation of numerical algorithms tailored for challenging partial differential equations. These equations encompass a diverse range of complexities, including hyperbolic equations, time-dependent equations, and coupled systems. 
The applications span a broad spectrum, encompassing fluid dynamics, flow and transport phenomena in porous media, magneto-hydrodynamics, material science, semiconductor device simulation, oceanography, and beyond.
