## Section 1: Root Finding

### Homework-Problem-1

In this exercise, you will implement your own fixed-point iteration algorithm and apply it to the following two functions separately. After implementing the algorithm, answer the questions listed below for each function.
1. $g_1(x) = x - x^5$
2. $g_2(x) = x + x^5$
### Questions:

**Q1:** What is the fixed point of each function? Explain why.

**Q2:** How is the fixed-point iteration applied to move from the current iteration $p_n$​ to the next iteration $p_{n+1}$​? Provide the formula used in this iteration process.

**Q3:** Does the fixed-point iteration provide a good approximation of the fixed point?
- If yes, discuss how to choose a suitable range for the search and what makes a good initial guess.
- If not, explain why not.  
In each case, use the theory covered in class to justify your reasoning.

**Q4:** Observe and discuss the convergence speed of the iteration.
**Hint:** The results of the two functions might be very different.
