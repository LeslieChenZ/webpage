# Research experience
PhD in Applied Mathematics, Brown University, advisor: [Chi-Wang Shu](https://www.dam.brown.edu/people/shu/)

My research interests lie broadly in:
* High order numerical methods, including but not limited to 
  * Discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods
  * Spectral methods, etc;
* Numerical methods for kinetic equations, fractional differential equations, uncertainty quantification and other applied areas such as finance, material science, etc;

# Potential research projects for students

### Detecting singularity information for functions/models through scientific machine learning techniques.

For functions or models with underlying rough data problems, its signals contain such important information, even though it is not clear by simply assembling the signals. 
It is somehow possible to be detected by smartly utilizing scientific machine learning techniques to assemble detectors. 
I am interested in playing around with ML toolbox for the purpose and apply the design to any related applications.

### High order numerical simulations.

High order numerical methods are highly efficient and robust in simulations for many models, and usually it is the case that with smart modification the simulations satisfy the physical requirements raised in the problems themselves. 
I am interested in designing, applying, and analyzing such methods for any challenging models raised in applications.
