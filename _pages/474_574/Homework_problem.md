## Problem 1

### Task
Read Chapter 1 in the Levy book. Pick one problem from the 25 problems listed in section 1.7. This could serve as your potential topic for the final project, so you are recommended to pick a continuous problem. Do the following for the problem:

### 1. State the mathematical optimization problem

#### a. Variables
Define the variables with notations and meanings. How many of them are there?

#### b. Objective Function
Write the objective function, and if possible, present it in a form to be minimized.

#### c. Constraints
Specify any constraints if they exist.

### 2. Observation and Comments

- What type of mathematical optimization problem is it? (Continuous or discrete)
- Is it unconstrained or constrained?

### 3. Hand Solution

Attempt to solve the problem manually and clearly demonstrate your approach, even though you might fail to solve it eventually. Include any steps, calculations, or observations you make during the manual solution.


### 4. Visualization

In addition, leverage computing tools such as Mathematica, Matlab, etc., to visually represent the optimization problem. Provide visualizations like contour plots or gradient vectors to enhance your understanding of the problem. Are there any specific insights, guidance, or clues that can aid in finding the solution? Mention them to enhance the comprehensibility of your analysis.


## Additional Notes
Include any additional notes or comments related to the problem. (TBD)
